    "[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)][1] is an approach to analyzing data that focuses on summarizing the main characteristics of a data set. One of EDA's major proponents, the venerable statistician [John Tukey][2], was a major force behind the acceptance of EDA into every modern day data scientist's toolbox, and his efforts to popularize the practice encouraged the development of statistical computing packages such as the [S][3] and [R][4] programming languages. The matplotlib library can itself be seen as being directly influenced by the work of Tukey. \n",

So, imagine you had the scatter plot above on a piece of graph paper, and you took a ruler and drew a line through that scatter plot in such a way that the sum of the distances between your line and every point in the data set was as small as possible. The reason for doing this is two fold: first, the line we produce gives us a fairly intuitive view into the relationship of the variables in our data, and second, it gives us an equation that we can use to roughly predict the value of the dependent variable, the variable on the y-axis, given a value for the independent variable.\n",

The [degree of an equation][4] is simply the largest exponent in that equation, and since we are fitting a [linear equation][5], our largest exponent, and hence our degree, will be 1. Since we already have a list of x values, all we have to do then, is create a list of y values by multiplying each x value in our list by the slope of our line and adding the y-intercept to get the corresponding y value.\n",

    "With the best fit line drawn on our scatter plot, we can definitely see a positive trend in the data. So, as it stands now, it would appear that the more education you have, the more you work, on average. The question then becomes, is this true because, as your level of education increases, so too does the availability of work? Or, is it because a higher level of education is indicative of a \"workaholic\" personality, and so individuals with higher levels of education just tend to work more? Or, is it due to some other factor that we haven't yet considered?\n",

    "The key here is that visualizing our data has led us to ask new questions and to form new hypotheses. This, in turn, could lead to further data collection and experimentation. The whole cycle is a giant feedback loop, where data exploration feeds inquiry and further insight. It's easy to see why this was one of the main reasons that John Tukey encouraged statisticians to participate in the practice of Exploratory Data Analysis.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we got our first peak at just how useful matplotlib can be, and in the process, we learned a little bit about a technique, popularized by the famous statistician John Tukey, called Exploratory Data Analysis. Along the way, we saw just how useful visualizing our data can be with respect to uncovering new questions and new ways of thinking about our data. We also saw how, even though our first attempt at visualizing data may not be exactly what we want, matplotlib gets us most of the way to a proper visualization right out of the box, and with just a little tweaking, it's possible to take the initial result and turn it into the perfect visualization. \n",

    "I hope this lesson has served to whet your appetite a bit for what's to come in future lessons. It is my hope, that by the end of this course, you will be properly equipped to interact with your data the way we just did in this lesson."
